[spoiler="download links"][quote][b]NOTE: Before downloading your cards from the cloud, please read the disclaimer below this spoiler (before the fun fact), there's something you need to know about.[/b]
Click one of those 2 links below to get started [s]on downloading ofc[/s]![quote][b][url=https://ztqcs-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/esigg_365user_net/El2nFdOlhmRDouHglqbkFdUBtBETOUj4g3XwFnR6Nfex_Q?e=lJORgH]OneDrive[/url][/b] | [b][url=https://jumpshare.com/b/WZ9EMAaJ7uqlZJYE527c]Jumpshare[/url][/b][/quote]File Specification: PNG, 360px width; 240px height, ~126-164 kB file size.[/quote]
[quote]I named your card(s) based on your MAL username on each separated folder btw. '-')/

[spoiler="file hierarchy system"][quote]Basically, it just like this:[code]Edition Name/Card Resolution/MAL_Username/MAL_Username - #Number [Specification].png
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                                            
You at here, btw                                            [/code][/quote][/spoiler]
If you are unable to find your folder, tap [b]Ctrl[/b] + [b]F[/b] (or tap [b]⌘[/b] + [b]F[/b] on Mac devices) on your keyboard, and type your MAL username.
Ah, also, there's no expiration date for the link... Even I've said so, I can't guarantee the files will remain on my cloud drives for a month later after this. Then you need to download it ASAP lol.[/quote]

[spoiler="disclaimer and apology letter"][quote]Currently, I have a big problem... Cards were swapped D:

Not that all, but those 2 cards, able to "kill" myself when I ready to ship (or deliver) it bruh... 30 people/requests out of 82 were affected from this problem.

If you found that you are one of affected by requesting "Pride! Edition" by The Newbie Club, I apologize for this problem. This problem is unavoidable, and totally out of intent.

As I mentioned before, 30 from 82 requests in total got wrong cards. The cards were totally swapped with each other on my PowerPoint file, which means "Yagate Kimi ni Naru" that should be placed on the third card, was swapped with 4th card, "Citrus." I know this is a human failure because I did not check arrangements BEFORE I started making cards... But again, as I said earlier, this problem is unavoidable, and totally out of intent.

As my commitment to my responsibility for the problem that we do not want this happened but it is already late, I have made my apology gift exclusively for whom got affected. You can find it directly in your folder.

Please take this gift as my apology, and thank you for spending your time to read this apology letter. ^^)/

Regards,
Natsu Tadama.
