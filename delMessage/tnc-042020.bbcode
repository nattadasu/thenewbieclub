If you are unable to find your card(s), tap [b]Ctrl[/b] + [b]F[/b] (or tap [b]âŒ˜[/b] + [b]F[/b] on Mac devices) on your keyboard, and type your MAL username.
Ah, also, there's no expiration date for the link... Even I told so, I can't guarantee the files will remain on my OneDrive for a month later after this. Then you need to download it ASAP lol.[/quote][quote]If you have any issue(s), prefer HD version than resized, or asking some questions, please [url=https://myanimelist.net/mymessages.php?go=send&toname=nattadasu]DM me[/url] ^^)[/quote][/spoiler]
[spoiler="disclaimer"][quote]I and all GFX staff on TNC noticed that there is something wrong with MyAnimeList CDN when loading/rendering my card which is way too problematic. The funniest thing is, even we're tried to resizing it with PhotoScape and upload it to several websites, the image still won't loaded at all.
But after a couple of tries, we've made it. The image is loaded after I've tried using an online service to optimize animated GIF. So, to helps other solving the exact problem, I made a tutorial on my GitHub personal repository to helps others :3
You can read the tutorial [url=https://github.com/nattadasu/Personal/blob/master/assets/tnchelper/troubleshooting.md][b]here[/b][/url].
Anyways, that all XD[/quote][/spoiler]
