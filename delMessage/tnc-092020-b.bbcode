If you are unable to find your folder, tap [b]Ctrl[/b] + [b]F[/b] (or tap [b]⌘[/b] + [b]F[/b] on Mac devices) on your keyboard, and type your MAL username.
Ah, also, there's no expiration date for the link... Even I've said so, I can't guarantee the files will remain on my cloud drives for a month later after this. Then you need to download it ASAP lol.

[spoiler="trivias"][quote][list][*]All of my graphic designs (including this delivery banner) are made by Microsoft Office PowerPoint lmaooo XD [s]with some help from Photoshop for card automation ofc[/s].
[*]Ah also, current edition process is (again) 100% automated. Please let me know if there's any problem.
[*]Card designs actually [s]staled from[/s] inspired by abandoned EvaNetor-Chan card and Spotify Daily Mix Playlist (although I didn't use Spotify anymore lmao). XD
[*]It's official: I will never provide Jumpshare download link because I'm concerned with:
1. Slow upload rate for Southeast Asian users, as well as me.
2. Unable to upload ~300 cards (avg/ed.) in one time via browser. Need to install app which I can't.
3. Limited UI/UX for mobile users
4. Storage limitation that's extremely limited.[/list]And because you have been reading so far to this part... Here's candy just for you c⌒っ╹v╹ )っ 🍬[/quote][/spoiler]
