## Introduction

![intro_Banner]()

Hello! Thank you for visiting this thread!

If you wonder why GFX team suddenly announce for survey, well it's due to stuff
happened lately, such as (but not limited to) administrative works, efficiency
between staff, and members whose disobey rules. So we decided to make one, as
we can hear what your thought about our works and criticism do you want to say.

This survey will ask about your experience with requesting on our bi-weekly
card edition releases, such as: schedule, clarity of rules and example, your
opinion on delivery tracker, criticism and suggestions, etcetera. We highly
suggest having requested cards once or multiple times previously before answering
this survey on The Newbie Club. If you haven't yet, you can check our
[latest card edition (closed)](https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1928535)
and compare it to [older thread](https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1899474)s.

If you want to participate our survey, you need to conduct our rules and privacy
policy below this section. Link will be provided on the bottom of this thread.
